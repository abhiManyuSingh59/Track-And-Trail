-->[Repository Title] : Track & Trail SomeOne! :)

As From the Above Title You must have Gained a basic notion that,
with this CODE we are going to track someone when he or she comes online.

#So Let's Dive Straight Into It :)
---->>With the Aid of this Repository One Can actually track someone's Online Time
---->>And One Can Actually Also Choose to Get Notified when someone they are tracking comes Online! 
---->>It is actually Handy Because People Can sometimes feel frustrating when they're on their work but while    they themselve open up the chat app they'll not feel disturbed as bad as before!

     ---->>You can track their Online time during whole day long & then you can try to match your own Online time when they come online with the Help of .pdf Sheet which shows BY timestamps when one was active.
         
     ---->>And also You can have a synchronous communication with the person  without having to wait for them to come online as they are currently Online!

#What's The Basic IDEA??,
_Well, Tracking Someone is so simple & Now that you have got this repository of Shivam it is Super Easy!!(Read Below).
We have to track a User when they come Online,
 So We want these following things 
-->>Asks User to Enter the Contact Info & Verify the Contact is in his Known Identifications #PrivacyMatters

-->>A Detailed Report in .pdf file format displaying when & for how long a user was ONLINE

-->>2 Clocks of 12 Hours Each which shows highlighted time when User was Online
--------1st Clock will show (AM) Anti Meridian Time from 12 in the MidNight to 12 in the Noon 
--------2nd Clock will show (PM) Post Meridian Time from 12 in the MidNight to 12 in the Noon

-->>So to Do this I have Created a whole Repository, just clone it in your local machine first!

^Sometimes for privacy I have made it such that the User Can track it for One Day on a free run only!
^Next Day after Initiating the User has to again ReVerify & ReEnter all the Details  
^so I will keep Updating the Repository & Follow me for getting Notified

Letâ€™s see how to do this with Python:
STEPS:-->
(1)Open Your Code Editor!! & before running install Java on your Machine
(2)MINIMIZE This File.
(3)Open the FILE in Android Studio
(4)Start Understanding & Applying the Concepts by Having a Go-through of the Code.
(5)Now RUN the Script on the Android Emulator & See the Magic happening!! It'll Track the Person :)
__CHEERS!! You Made It!!
